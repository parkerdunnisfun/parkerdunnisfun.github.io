  <h2 style="text-align:center">Chrony Style Checker</h2>
  <p>
  Being an editor for the Daily Utah Chronicle (affectionately, the Chrony), I thought it would be helpful if I made a program that could quickly point out errors in following one of the most common Chrony style rules: "When referring to the University of Utah, first use the entire name, then 'the U' on all subsequent references." The program not only does this but also converts dates to Chrony style.
  </p>
  <p>
  The program GUI has two text boxes, one to check for the "University of Utah" rule mentioned above, the other to convert dates to Chrony/AP style. With the first box, simply paste any text and hit the "Check" button to check for accuracies and errors with the rule. Accuracies and errors will be highlighted in green and red, respectively. With the second box, type a date in mm/dd/yyyy format, hit the "Convert" button and the text box will show the converted date.
